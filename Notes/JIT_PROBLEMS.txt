As of Mono 2.8.1, there are the following problems with the JIT:

* the JIT handling of aligment is poor; sometimes makes functions 10x slower
* Mono.Simd has no ref overloads, so fallbacks are unnecessarily slow
* the JIT does not deal well with Vector4 wrapping Vector4f indirection, makes opn_Multiply 5x slower
* on x86 the JIT uses x87 FPU, so comparisons to SSE are not fair
* JIT doesn't seem to inline methods that simply call another method, e.g. opertor overloads calling 
  static method, so I inlined a lot by hand
